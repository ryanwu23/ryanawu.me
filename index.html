  <div id="About" class="tabcontent">
    <div class="content">
      <p>I am a sophomore at Dartmouth College and pursuing a degree in computer science and on a pre-medical track.
        I have acedemic interests in both computer science and in medicine and hope to work in the intersection of the two fields as I believe computational medicine is the future of medicine.
        I was born in Missouri but am from and have spent most of my life in Lexington, Massachusetts, a suburb outside of Boston.
        I have 4 brothers (3 older and one younger) and a dog named Lychee.

      <h3>Laboratory of Medical Imaging and Computation (Jun 2018 - Sep 2018)</h3>
      <p>Machine Learning Intern</p>
      <p>Used python to program and co-publish a brain hemorrhage identification application which is used by medical professionals at Massachusetts General Hospital.
        This application uses machine learning to detect the probability of a brain hemorrhage in any CT image uploaded.
        Can't share the github repo nor the application because the lab and hospital doesn't allow it.
        Below is an example of the application.

      <h3>Swimming</h3>
      <p>I have been swimming ever since I was around 10 and swam up until last year.
        Swimming was a big part of my high school experiance and I served as captain of the varisty boys team my senior year.
        My favorite stroke is definitely backstroke or freestyle and I hate butterfly with a passion.
        Even though I stopped swimming in college I still love to get into the pool as much as I can.
      </p>
