      <h3>Laboratory of Medical Imaging and Computation (Jun 2018 - Sep 2018)</h3>
      <p>Machine Learning Intern</p>
      <p>Used python to program and co-publish a brain hemorrhage identification application which is used by medical professionals at Massachusetts General Hospital.
        This application uses machine learning to give the probability of a brain hemorrhage in an uploaded brain CT image.
        Can't share the github repo nor the application because the lab and hospital won't allow it.
        Below is an example of the application.

      <h2>Swimming:</h2>
      <p>I have been swimming ever since I was around 10 yet stopped competitive swim when I came to college.
        Swimming was a big part of my high school experience and I served as captain of the varsity team my senior year.
        My favorite stroke is definitely backstroke or freestyle and I hate butterfly with a passion.
        Even though I stopped swimming in college I still love to get into the pool as much as possible.
        (also yes I know my hair is messy in this photo)
      </p>
