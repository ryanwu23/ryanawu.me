# Website ryanawu.me README
This is the code base of my personal website.

## Viewing the website:
You can see the cite at ryanawu.me or if you want to run it on your local machine, run python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000 in the directory and open http://localhost:9000/.

## Implementation:
The website was implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
All the images used for the website can be found in the images folder.
For the contact page I also used https://fontawesome.com/ in order to use the icons.
Since the website is just an informational one, the js is pretty simple.
